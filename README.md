# What tools are in your data science tool kit?

## Let's build a classifier!

- Here's the data set we're going to work with:
- http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

### Goal:
- Develop, test, and document a classifier to predict the "class" column of the data set.
- Please hold out a random 10% for an out-of-sample validation. Don't peek!

### Bonus Points:
- R
  - markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
  - dplyr (http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)
  - caret (http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html)
- Spark (https://spark.apache.org/mllib/)
